# Custom Functions

## Introduction
Custom Functions is a feature provided by HarperDB that allows you to host your own API routes on the same Instance as HarperDB, by extending the underlying Fastify API.

## Deployment
To deploy the Custom Functions package, I've prepared a script within the `scripts` folder in the root of the repository.
